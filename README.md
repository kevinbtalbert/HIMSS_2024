### 2. Warehouse/Store HL7 Data in CDW / Generate Dashboard

Optional component, this is a great way to show loading medical data directly into CDW and Using Data Viz for visuals.

### 3. Use Solr/Banana to show indexing patient conditions from logged HL7 data 
Note that the below 2 components require completing the Final AMP Setup (Manual) at the bottom of the Readme.

#### Solr component

Browse to https://[SOLR SERVER CML APPLICATION]/solr to Solr homepage and view the `hl7_messages` collection **hl7**

2. Execute Solr Setup Scripts (can be done in session or by the created Job) - Create collection, generate data, add data, add stopwords, make dashboard

    If in session, run script: `4_solr/execute-solr-scripts.py`

    If by job, run `Execute Solr Scripts` job that was created during AMP setup (preferred)

3. Navigate to `https://[CML APPLICATION]/solr/banana/src/index.html#/dashboard` to view Banana UI
